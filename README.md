# 📊 Linear Regression - Hands-On Project

This project demonstrates a hands-on implementation of **Linear Regression** using Python and libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`. The goal is to understand how linear regression works on real data and visualize the results clearly.
